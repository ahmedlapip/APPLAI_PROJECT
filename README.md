# Stroke Prediction Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on a range of patient characteristics. The model leverages a variety of features to provide accurate and actionable insights that can aid in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Features

The model uses the following features for prediction:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each patient
- **gender**: Gender of the patient (e.g., Male, Female)
- **age**: Age of the patient
- **hypertension**: Whether the patient has hypertension (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **heart_disease**: Whether the patient has heart disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **ever_married**: Marital status of the patient (e.g., Yes, No)
- **work_type**: Type of work the patient is engaged in (e.g., Private, Self-employed, Government job, etc.)
- **Residence_type**: Type of residence (e.g., Urban, Rural)
- **avg_glucose_level**: Average glucose level in the blood
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index (BMI)
- **smoking_status**: Smoking status of the patient (e.g., Unknown, Formerly smoked, Never smoked, Smokes)
- **stroke**: Target variable indicating whether the patient had a stroke (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Model Overview

This repository includes the following:
- **Data Preparation**: Scripts for preprocessing and feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: Code for training the machine learning model using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation**: Tools and scripts for evaluating model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
- **Deployment**: Instructions for deploying the model as a web service or integrating it into existing healthcare systems.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:


## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your dataset in the designated folder and run the preprocessing script.

2. **Training**: Execute the training script to build the model:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Evaluation**: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using the evaluation script:
    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py
    ```

4. **Deployment**: Follow the deployment instructions provided in the `docs` folder.
